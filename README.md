# Touch Carrefuly And Nothing Explodes

# TCANE - Unity Project

Project developed for the [PI](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=520335) course. 

## Description

This project aimed to study the impact of haptic feedback on user experience in immersive environments, specifically through a game developed during the course.

Three scenarios were initially planned for comparison:
1. Using standard Oculus VR controllers.
2. Using a 3D interaction device, Geomagic Touch, without haptic feedback.
3. Using the same device with haptic feedback.

The game prototype was based on "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes," where the Geomagic Touch device would be used to disarm an explosive device, exploring gameplay variations and their effect on user experience.

However, due to the project's scope, testing was limited to using the device with haptic feedback only, focusing on evaluating user performance and feedback in a virtual environment.

This approach aimed to provide users with a new experience, helping them assess the comfort and desirability of using haptic feedback in immersive settings.
